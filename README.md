# Profile card component solution

This is a solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ).

In addition to the challenge, I also fetched random user data from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to populate the card.
